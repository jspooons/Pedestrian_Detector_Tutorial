# Pedestrian_Detector_Tutorial

The notebook in this repository follows the tutorial created by [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torchvision_tutorial.html).
It shows how to apply transfer learning to a pre-trained object detection model.

The new, fine-tuned, model is able to detect pedestrians in an image.
