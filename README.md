# Pedestrian_Detector_Tutorial

The notebook in this repository follows the tutorial created by [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torchvision_tutorial.html).
It shows how to apply transfer learning to a pre-trained object detection model.

The new, fine-tuned, model is able to detect pedestrians in an image. The notebook works out-of-the-box in google colab, however, the last cell uses an image found in this repo (or in the pytorch tutorial) which can be imported into Colab to allow the cell to run with no errors. This just allows you to see the bounding boxes around the pedstrians and their masks.
